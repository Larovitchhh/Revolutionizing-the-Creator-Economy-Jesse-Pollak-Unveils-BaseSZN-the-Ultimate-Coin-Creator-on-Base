 Empowering the UnderservedBaseSZN addresses a core pain point: Creators in Web2 lose out on value. On Base, they monetize directly â€“ no middlemen, no 95% platform cuts. Pollak envisions "creator capital markets," where tokens reflect real influence, not just hype.

 This ties into Base's broader push: On-chain donations for US politicians (launched July 2024), non-USD stablecoins for global utility, and bridging non-EVM assets like wrapped SOL and DOGE.

The result? A flywheel of virality. Creators earn from content coins, funds index for long-term bets, and Base grows as the "center of the onchain economy."

 Early metrics show promise: Base's creator tools have driven billions in volume, with Pollak teasing a native Base token to further incentivize participation.
