To understand BaseSZN, you first need to know Jesse Pollak. A serial builder in the crypto space, Pollak joined Coinbase in 2017 after founding Clef, a passwordless identity startup acquired by the exchange. He scaled Coinbase's consumer engineering team from three to 250 engineers, laying the groundwork for products like Coinbase Pro and the original Coinbase Wallet. But it was his 2021 mandate from CEO Brian Armstrong – to bring Coinbase "on-chain" – that sparked the creation of Base.Launched in 2023 as an Ethereum Layer 2 built on the OP Stack, Base has exploded in adoption. It now boasts over 81 billion stablecoin transactions in a single month, representing $1.5 trillion in volume, and supports 12 local-currency stablecoins like those pegged to the Indonesian rupiah and Brazilian real.

 Pollak, now head of protocols at Coinbase and leader of both Base and the rebranded Coinbase Wallet (now Base App), has been vocal about shifting crypto's focus from traders to creators. "The Web2 model has failed creators, who generate significant value for major platforms but see little in return," he said at Token2049 in Singapore earlier this year. "Platforms capture about 95% of the value while creators receive less than 5%."

Pollak's philosophy? Base isn't just a blockchain; it's the "foundational layer for on-chain culture."

 And BaseSZN is his latest tool to make that vision tangible.
